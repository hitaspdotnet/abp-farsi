# abp-farsi
This repository is created to translate localizations of ABP Framework to the Farsi aka Persian language

How to contribute:

Reference to [Resource Localization](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Contribution/Index#resource-localization) we have a `abp-translate.json` file which includes all neccessary key/values of the localizations which I already executed `abp translate -c fa` command and generated latest version (5.2.1) of the file.

To avoid confilict, I belive we can open an issue and select a range of translation each time and then close the issue after finishing the range. Check below example:

There is total 11606 lines of data:
